Developed by Edison Xavier

#Details:

Domain: Computer Vision

Framework: TensorFlow & Keras

Deployment: Streamlit

Date: October 2025

#Objective:
To classify fish species from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and pre-trained deep learning models.

Dataset:

Folder structure: train/, val/, test/

Images of multiple fish species

Total Classes: 11 fish categories

Goal:
Build a robust model, compare multiple architectures, and deploy a real-time classification app.

#Data Preprocessing & Augmentation

Steps:

Rescaled all images to [0, 1] range

Applied augmentation:

Rotation (¬±20¬∞)

Zoom (20%)

Horizontal Flip

Image Size: 224√ó224

Batch Size: 32

#Model Training

Approach 1 ‚Äì Custom CNN:
Built from scratch using 3 Conv2D + MaxPooling layers with Dropout.

Approach 2 ‚Äì Transfer Learning:
Fine-tuned these pretrained models:

VGG16

ResNet50

MobileNet

InceptionV3

EfficientNetB0 (optional/fallback to weights=None)

Training Details:

Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.0001)

Loss: Categorical Crossentropy

Epochs: 10

#Model Evaluation Metrics

Metrics Computed:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

#Confusion Matrix & Plots

Include screenshots or sample visuals:

Confusion Matrix heatmap

Accuracy vs Epochs (Training/Validation)

Loss vs Epochs plots

Interpretation:

The model shows clear separation between fish categories.

Minor confusion among similar species (e.g., sea_bass vs red_sea_bream).

#Model Saving

Saved File:
best_fish_model.pkl

Description:

Serialized using pickle.dump()

Contains architecture + trained weights

Reused during Streamlit deployment

#Streamlit Deployment

Goal:
Allow users to upload fish images and get real-time predictions.

Features:

Upload .jpg / .png fish image

Predict species instantly

Display confidence scores as a bar chart

App Output:
üéØ Predicted: Red Mullet
üìä Confidence: 96.8%
